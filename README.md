# Description
Business Around the World is video game made for the FBLA Middle School Video Game Challenge Competition. Players learn about business etiquette in 5 different countries: America, Japan, Egypt, Mexico, and France. They fly to each country on a plane, collecting balloons while avoiding obstacles like birds and clouds to achieve the highest score.

# Design Process
## Pre-Production

Before we began making our game, we set down a few features we wanted to be included:
- Traveling around the world.
- Dialogue explaining business etiquette in each country.
- Win/Lose scenarios and a score.
- Levels that get progressively more difficult.

We came up with the idea of having the player start in America. There, a character called Erica asks the player to fly around the world to take her spot in meetings. The player arrives to each country in a plane, and learns about business etiquette at each destination. While flying, you would dodge obstacles and collect points to increase your score. You would have 3 hearts at the begining of the flight, however once you hit an obstacle you will lose hearts. Once you run out of hearts, the game is over. As you travel more, the sky and clouds get darker, and everything starts moving faster, making it more difficult as you progress. After you have already gone to each country, you go back to America where Erica thanks and congratulates you.

We decided on 5 countries, America, Japan, Egypt, Mexico, and France. We also decided that the obstacles would be birds and clouds. The clouds are larger, but they move slower, and the birds are smaller, but they are much faster. You can collect yellow balloons to increase your score, and heart balloons to give you an extra life.

## Production

We started the production of the game in Scratch. We began with randomly colored rectangles for each sprite, outlining the shape and hitboxes. After finishing the main coding, we made all of the art in a pixel art style and added a play button along with the title of the game.

## Post-Production

To begin the post-production stage, we fixed small bugs and made small changes to the quality of the game. Then we created the sounds. Some of the sounds we made ourselves by hitting random objects, while other sounds were modified versions of the sounds Scratch provides.

Finally we created the music, in musescore. Music plays every time you meet a new charcter, fly to another destination, and lose. Every piece of music in the game is based on the same main melody, but is changed to fit the mood and idea. For example, when flying, the music is arranged for a full symphony orchestra, plus an electric guitar, an electric bass, drums, and synths. When it starts, the melody is played by the guitar and is accompanied by the drums, bass, and synth. As you get closer to the destination, all the parts are distributed to the rest of the orchestra and the music gets faster and more intense. Each time you meet someone, the melody is played in the style of the traditional music from that country. We did lots of research to make sure the music was accurate to ecah countries' culture. The japanese variation of the melody features traditional japanese instruments such as the taikos, the shakuhachi, the shamisen, and the koto, and uses the hirojashi scale and fourth based harmony. And finally, when you lose, a variation of this melody is played on a soft felted piano. It alternates from being in a minor key, to a major key, giving it a sad but hopeful sound. We knew that music deeply affects the experience of a game, so we wanted to make sure that our game was filled with music that supports the ideas being shown.
